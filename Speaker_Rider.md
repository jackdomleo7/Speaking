# Speaker Rider <small>(Jack Domleo)</small>

Before I agree to speak at a conference, meetup, or event, I do research to make sure that it aligns with my goals and interests.

I am always grateful to organisers who ask me to participate! I always ask for a short explanation as to why I have been chosen. I also ask for as many details as possible.

## Hosting accommodations

### Speaker honorarium

- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too). Preparing talks requires time and effort that I have to take out of my day.
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive this based on ticket pricing, scholarship programs, etc.
- I won't specify a fee figure here, so make an offer (preferably converted to Â£GBP if possible) and we can negotiate. I may accept other benefits as a form of payment, however this is entirely dependent (I don't accept "exposure" as a fee).

### Travel

- I am currently in no position to travel anywhere outside of the East Midlands, UK (I am currently based in [Nottinghamshire, UK](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nottinghamshire/@53.1456059,-1.2855997,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487832d2390779cd:0x54afc970e5ef2912!8m2!3d53.100319!4d-0.9936306) - East Midlands includes Nottingham, Derby and Leicester) for in-person events.
- I ask for parking details as it's likely I will be driving and I ask that miles/fuel and parking fees are reimbursed.
- I may travel anywhere in the UK if I am able to, however this is entirely dependent on the situation.

### Lodging

- I ask that at least 1 night hotel accommodation (with parking) is offered for events outside of the East Midlands (if I accept). However, I may to choose to just stay the day, depending on how far away from Nottinghamshire the event is.

### Virtual events

- I personally prefer live talks rather than pre-recording videos. Pre-recording involves a lot of editing time and skills (skills that I don't have) because of the nature of the medium. If you highly prefer pre-recording, please consider the time commitment with speaker honorariums, or have an editor on your team who can do those edits.
- During talks, please include some sort of moderation of comments (preferably before they go live for the audience to see). Internet trolls unfortunately exist, and have ruined talk playbacks in the past. I am fully against blocking criticism as I believe criticism is healthy, but any abuse or related content should be reviewed.

### Ticket

- I ask for a ticket to the full conference (virtual or in-person) as a speaker. I love participating in conferences, engaging with other attendees, and attending talks!

### Speech impediment

- I have a lifelong stammer. I do not require any special accommodation for my speech impediment, not do I want to be treated any differently. During my speech therapy sessions, I regularly practice techniques to help me _stutter more fluently_.
- If required, I will notify the audience at the beginning of a talk of my speech impediment.

## Logistics

### Code of Conduct

- Please provide a Code of Conduct (preferably short and simple).

### Recordings/Intellectual Property

- As long as I am told beforehand, I am fine being recorded. Just be sure to get my best side! ðŸ˜‰
- I guarantee that everything I do is rated "PG" with no swearing or inappropriate/explicit remarks.
- I own all of my talks. All my talks are stored within [this repository](https://github.com/jackdomleo7/Talks). I can either create a new talk for your event, or reuse one of my previous talks - your choice.
- All talks within the [Event Specific Talks](https://github.com/jackdomleo7/Talks/tree/main/Event%20Specific%20Talks) folder are joint own between myself and the event organisers and therefore cannot be reused.

### Extra

- The ability to use my own computer/setup is preferred. I've been to some events where they require me to use their machines, which works if I'm just using slides, but I often live-code in my talks and unfamiliar keyboard layouts can lead to a less fluid presentation. This is also important for those who need to use assistive technologies on a given machine!

## Why might I decline?

If I decline, please do not be offended, as there could be various reasons (I may or may not decide to share my decline reason), here are some reasons:

- I don't have the time. I work full-time and have a life, so may not have time to create a talk or give the talk.
- The event may not align with my goals or expertise.
- The talk asked of me may not be in my area of my expertise.
- The event may be too political for me to want to be a part of.
- Calendar conflicts.
